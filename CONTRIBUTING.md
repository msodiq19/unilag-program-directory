Thanks for being willing to contribute!

## Project setup

    Fork and clone the repo
    Create a branch for your PR with git checkout -b pr/your-branch-name

    Tip: Keep your main branch pointing at the original repository and make pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/msodiq19/unilag-program-directory.git
    git fetch upstream
    git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main

    This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local main branch to use the upstream main branch whenever you run git pull. Then you can make all of your pull request branches based on this main branch. Whenever you want to update your version of main, do a regular git pull.
